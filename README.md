# GuessMyNumber.github.io
As simples as it is, it can be quite fun. The player chooses a random number between 1 and 20, trying to guess the random generated number.
If the number chosen is higher, it will appear a message saying so, as well as for lower. 
Just to make the experience a bit more rewarding, there is a highscore, lastscore and an average score.
The button again, of course, resets the layout, but not the scores. 
The game was thought out, considering almost all possibilities: it isnÂ´t possible to put a number less than 1 or greater than 20; the button again only works if the player has started at least one time; etc...
I hope you like it.
